# Assignment 1: Interactive Visual Item Project

## Description
DES 427-02 Mary Ann Macabenta
This is the first project for our Interactive Design II. The goal of this project is to create an interactive birthday card that brings joy, surprise, and presents a heartfelt message to the intended target user, Thomas (my boyfriend). The user will be able to explore the card and uncover the incorporated visual and interactive elements. 

## Usage
To use this project, you should start with a blank starting page that greets Thomas a happy birthday. It encourages the user to click using the mouse; this will play Thomas' favorite polka song. You can press the "t" key to hear Thomas sing, and press "a" to make him stop. Press the space bar to display another message wishing him the best day ever.
